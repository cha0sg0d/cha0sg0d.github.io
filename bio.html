	<p>Tony “Fat Tony” Goss, hailing from the rainy city of Seattle, is one of the newest additions to the Tufts Ultimate team. Growing up an avid Seahawks fan, he learned from a young age that it’s always better to pass the ball than run it, even when, say, you’re on the one yard line in the Super Bowl and have the best RB in the league. It was this mentality that attracted him to the sport where the biscuits fly far and no one ever runs with the disc.</p>
