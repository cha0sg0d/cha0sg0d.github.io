	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p id = "info">Anthony Goss (Tony) (He/Him) is a sophomore at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science. He was born and raised in Seattle and attended Garfield High School. As an awkward high school freshman, he stumbled upon a youth leadership program that took students on an immersion in Guatemala. While working in an Antiguan hospital together with local teenagers, he discovered a passion for building relationships across cultural divides and elevating the voices of those with less systemic power. Back in Seattle, he continued to learn by volunteering with Casa Latina and Para Los Ni√±os, two organizations that work to empower the Latinx community. In college, he became involved with criminal justice reform by tutoring incarcerated people studying for their high school equivalency exam. He is excited to explore the intersection of data science and social justice and learn about the use of storytelling as a community organizing tool. In his free time, he plays ultimate frisbee, reads, and tries to make his cats remember him after his time away at school.
