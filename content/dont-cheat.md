Here's how I built this [website](https://https://github.com/cha0sg0d/cha0sg0d.github.io).

### Rules
1. No frameworks I don't understand. This means that although I can use React, I haven't looked at its source code and thus don't know how it works.
2. No static site generators.
    If I wanted to just write on the Web, I'd be on Wordpress by now.
3. Describe every line of code.

### Stack:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Node.js for static site generation.
4. Markdown for blogs.
5. Github Pages + Fleek.co -> Ethereum Name Service (more on this later)

### Procedure
1. Follow @izloate's [tutorial](https://izolate.net/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator) for generating static web sites
2. Add in my css + planet image
3. Edit the code base to add custom bodies
4. Host!
