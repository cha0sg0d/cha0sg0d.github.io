### What is Ethereum?

A global computer that anyone can use.  

You pay $ (ether) based on the amount of computation you need. For example, the cost of 10 'add' operations is 10x more than 1 'add'.

**Pros of Blockhain Computing**

- Data is permanent and public
- Composable. Many apps can be built on the public data source .

**Cons of Blockchain Computing**
- Slow because of security and verification requirements (ensuring everyone in the network agrees on the state of the global computer)
- Shared network congestion.
- Not user friendly
