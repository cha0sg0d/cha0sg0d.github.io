### My learning is broken
There's a million ways to put content on the Internet. I've personally worked with React, Next.js, Django, Boostrap, vanilla HTML + CSS, and been scared off by Angular and Vue. Although these frameworks help people put stuff on the Internet quickly and easily, they don't help people *understand* the Internet. When a framework is working, it makes my life wayyy easier. When it breaks, it's harder to debug because *I don't know how it works in the first place*.

As a college CS student I could spin up a `create-react-app` but can't explain what a web browser does (displays HTML) or why (Tim BL and the World Wide Web). Unfortunately, my college CS education has tended towards preparing me to solve little problems -- debug my React code -- without understanding the big picture (wtf is electricty? how is a computer built? who profits from the digital age and why?).

### Do it differently
So my goal with this blog is simply to understand concepts, and share my explanations as I go.
It took me four years and an expensive college education to honestly ask myself: *how do I really learn?*
It's not via Zoom lectures and textbooks, that's for sure. It's by doing, learning for *understanding*, and challenging myself for reasons other than a grade.
